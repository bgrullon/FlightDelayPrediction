## Project Descripton 
#### Comparing Historical Flight and Weather data to determine the propability of delay versus weather conditions.

## Research Questions to Answer
1. What is the correlation between precipitation and flight delays ?
2. What is the correlation between windspeed and flight delays ?
3. What is the correlation between temp and flight delays ? 

## Datasets to be used
[Flight data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018)

[Weather Data from Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/)
