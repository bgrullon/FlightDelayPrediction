### What is the correlation between precipitation and flight delays?
The correlation between precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, etc.) and flight delays is generally considered to be moderately negative. In other words, as precipitation increases, flight delays tend to increase, and vice versa.

When there is precipitation, it can lead to various operational challenges at airports and during flights. Some of the factors that contribute to flight delays during precipitation include:

Reduced visibility: Rain, fog, or snow can decrease visibility, which may lead to delays in takeoff, landing, and taxiing.
De-icing procedures: During snowy or icy conditions, planes may need to be de-iced before departure, which can add time to the turnaround process.
Ground operations: Adverse weather conditions can slow down ground operations, such as loading and unloading baggage, fueling, and catering.
Air traffic control adjustments: Precipitation can lead to changes in air traffic control procedures, including increased spacing between aircraft and rerouting to avoid severe weather areas.
Aircraft performance: Wet or icy runways can affect aircraft performance during takeoff and landing, potentially leading to longer takeoff runs or requiring additional distance for braking.
It's important to note that while there is a general negative correlation between precipitation and flight delays, other factors also come into play. For example, airports and airlines with robust contingency plans and well-prepared infrastructure may be better equipped to handle adverse weather conditions, potentially reducing the impact of precipitation on flight schedules.

Keep in mind that correlations can vary based on the region, the severity and frequency of precipitation events, the season, and the individual airport's capabilities. As such, the correlation between precipitation and flight delays may not be uniform across all locations and circumstances.
