### Analsys based on Precipitation

# Scatter plot 1

## With a correlation coefficient of 0.06, the correlation between precipitation and flight delays in your is very weak. A correlation coefficient close to zero suggests that there is little to no linear relationship between the two variables. In this scenario, the low correlation value indicates that changes in precipitation do not have a substantial impact on flight delays, at least in a linear manner. 

# Plot the linear regression model 1

## With an R-squared value of approximately 0.0042, it indicates that only a very small proportion of the variation in flight delays can be explained by changes in precipitation. In other words, the linear regression model with precipitation as the predictor does not provide an accurate representation of the relationship between precipitation and flight delays. There are other factors and variables that contribute to flight delays that are not captured by the linear relationship with precipitation.

# Scatter plot 2

## With a correlation coefficient of 0.05, the correlation between precipitation and departure delays in dataset is very weak. This suggests that there is little to no linear relationship between precipitation and the duration of departure delays Similar to the previous analysis for arrival delays, a correlation coefficient close to zero indicates that changes in precipitation have minimal impact on departure delays, at least in a linear manner. As mentioned earlier, correlation does not imply causation, so this weak correlation does not necessarily mean that precipitation has no effect on departure delays. Other factors or interactions may play a more significant role in determining the duration of departure delays.

# Plot the linear regression model 1

## With an R-squared value of approximately 0.0026, it confirms that the linear regression model for predicting departure delays based on precipitation is very low  for the data. The R-squared value being so close to zero indicates that the linear model explains very little of the variability in departure delays using precipitation as the predictor. As mentioned previously, a low R-squared value suggests that changes in precipitation have minimal influence on the duration of departure delays. It is likely that other factors, not captured in the linear relationship with precipitation, play a more significant role in determining the extent of departure delays.

## Top 10 Airports with Highest Precipitation: The top 10 airports with the highest precipitation levels are ranked based on the total precipitation received at each airport. These airports have experienced the most significant amount of precipitation among all airports in the dataset. The specific airports in the top 10 list may vary depending on the dataset and the time period for which the data was collected Precipitation levels at these airports could impact flight operations, airport infrastructure, and passenger experiences during periods of high precipitation.
## Top 10 Airports with Lowest Precipitation: The top 10 airports with the lowest precipitation levels are ranked based on the total precipitation received at each airport. These airports have experienced the least amount of precipitation among all airports in the dataset. The airports in this list may represent regions with dry climates or areas that experience limited rainfall. Low precipitation levels might have implications for water availability, agricultural practices, and ecological considerations in these regions.

### The summary statistics provided above pertain to the top 10 airports with the highest precipitation levels. These statistics are calculated based on the "Origin Precipitation" data for the selected airports. Let's break down each statistic:

# Count: The count indicates the number of data points available for these top 10 airports. In this case, there are 10 data points, one for each airport in the list.

# Mean: The mean (or average) represents the arithmetic average of the "Origin Precipitation" values for the top 10 airports. The mean precipitation across these airports is approximately 14.61 units.
# Standard Deviation (Std): The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the "Origin Precipitation" values are from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more dispersed. In this case, the standard deviation is approximately 7.70, which means that the precipitation values vary quite significantly from the mean.
# Minimum (Min): The minimum value represents the smallest "Origin Precipitation" value among the top 10 airports. The lowest precipitation value for these airports is approximately 8.69 units.
# 5th Percentile (Q1): The 25th percentile (Q1) is the value below which 25% of the "Origin Precipitation" data points fall. In other words, 25% of the top 10 airports have precipitation values below approximately 9.06 units.
# Median (50th Percentile or Q2): The median is the middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending order. It represents the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of the "Origin Precipitation" data points are below this value. The median precipitation across these airports is approximately 11.23 units.
# 5th Percentile (Q3): The 75th percentile (Q3) is the value below which 75% of the "Origin Precipitation" data points fall. In other words, 75% of the top 10 airports have precipitation values below approximately 18.75 units.
# Maximum (Max): The maximum value represents the largest "Origin Precipitation" value among the top 10 airports. The highest precipitation value for these airports is approximately 30.33 units.
# In summary, these statistics provide data of the distribution of "Origin Precipitation" values for the top 10 airports with the highest precipitation. The data shows that the precipitation levels can vary significantly across these airports, with some airports experiencing much higher precipitation than others. The statistics help in understanding the range and variability of precipitation among these top airports.
