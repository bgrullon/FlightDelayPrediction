## Analysis conclusions based on Windspeed

#### The questions I was seeking to answer was "Is there a correlation between destination windspeed and flight delay time?". To answer this question I used scatter plots and linear regression to identify correlating trends in the data. When Departure delays were compared to destination windspeeds the Pearson's coefficient was 0.101 showing a very weak correlation, and further the R~2~ value was 0.0127 showing a very weak correlation. The same was the case for arrival delays vs windspeed with a Pearson's coefficient and R~2~ value of 0.113 and 0.0079 respectively. I examined smaller subsets of the data like the upper quartile of windspeeds, and delays over 30 minutes and 60  minutes, and the correlations were still very weak. Because of this I conclude that there is little to no correlation between flight delays and destination wind speed.
