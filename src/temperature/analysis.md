## Analysis conclusions based on Temperature

### Correlation Coefficients:
#### The correlation coefficient between Temperature and Flight Delay is -0.03. This suggests a very weak negative linear relationship between temperature and flight delays. The correlation coefficient between Dew Point and Flight Delay is 0.1. This indicates a very weak positive linear relationship between dew point and flight delays. The correlation is quite small, suggesting that there is only a weak linear correlation between these variables.
### R-squared Values:
#### The R-squared value of Temperature vs. Flight Delay is 0.00117. This means that only 0.117% of the variance in flight delays can be explained by the variation in temperature. The R-squared value of Dew Point vs. Flight Delay is 0.0136. This implies that only 1.36% of the variance in flight delays can be explained by the variation in dew point.
### Logistic Regression Model:
#### The accuracy score of the logistic regression model is 0.61, which means that the model correctly predicts the class label (delayed or not delayed) for approximately 61% of the instances in the dataset. While this score is above 50% (random guessing), it indicates that the model's predictive performance is limited.
